This repository contains my lab 1 text and 4 figures from the lab. The subdirectory starts with figure one and goes to figure four down the list and ends with the text file. The last 2 figures are semilog graphs that were created and the first two are more basic graphs plotting x against p(x). I saved my first code as a text file and not a py file. The graphs all have x and y labels added to them. The code has errors within that I fixed right after.}
